    <p>The Nature Club was founded in August 2020 by Dr Yogesh M Nimdeo. It includes various student-driven activities like trekking, nature exploring, workshops, wildlife photography, plantation and awareness programs etc. Later on, the adventurous sports activities carried out by Institute Sports Association were also clubbed with Nature Club in 2022, and the club was renamed Nature and Adventure Club, IIT Jammu (NAC). NAC nurtured nature exploring and adventure activities, which fostered adventure, trekking, and outward-bound activities among the science, and engineering professionals, students, and faculty communities of the Indian Institute of Technology Jammu.</p>
<p>In 2022 and 2023, NAC has done various activities like</p>
<p>1. Trekking</p>
<p>2. Paragliding</p>
<p>3. River rafting</p>
<p>4. Zig-zag Zipline</p>
<p>5. Plantation of fruit and flower-bearing as well as forest plants species in the institute on
different national and international occasions</p>
<p>6. Seed ball activities at the beginning of the monsoon</p>
<p>7. Site seen to explore Jammu and Kashmir forests in collaboration with the J & K Forest
<p>Department, and many more.</p>
<p>In its enlarged form as of today, NAC encompasses four more sections. They are:</p>
<p>· The Database Management Section</p>
<p>· The Event Management Section</p>
<p>· The Designing section</p>
<p>· The Workshop Organisation Section</p>
Recently, at the Annual Flower Show-2023 competition organised by CSIR-IIIM - on 12th March 2023, NAC was awarded the first prize for the best gardens and lawns among educational institutions in Jammu. It's all because of the consistent guidance of the honourable Director IIT Jammu and the efforts of NAC to develop arboriculture and horticulture in the institute. Overall, the organisation of adventure activities, trekking, green workshops, and plantation programmes by the Nature and Adventure Club in the Institute bring harmony among the students towards nature, which awakened the spirit of adventure activities and plantation among the institute community.</p>
